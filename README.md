The official repository for >use lamp, a fun and lower-priority passion project of Thorne Melcher, GPLed to allow others
to tinker with the code to make exactly the game they want.

**NOTICE**: This is very much a work in progress and still lacks much support or documentation.

The game is designed in a variation on MVC where classes to handle different in-game commands (which extend the base abstract
Command class) fill the role normally occupied by controllers.

Portions of the code from the MIT-licensed (and thus GPL-compatible) Doctrine project (http://www.doctrine-project.org/) in order
to streamline database interactions.
